A passion for jewellery and desire for the unorthodox is what brought sisters Radhika Khunteta and Ayesha Rawat together to launch Citrine in 2013. The duo developed a love for jewellery at a young age and grew up to pursue the same with a diploma in jewellery design from The International Gemological Institute, Mumbai.
Experimenting with colour, cut and casting, these designerâ€™s aim is to use their jewellery to make women feel glamorous and special every single day of their lives.

Citrine brings to you an exquisite range of handcrafted semi-precious statement jewellery. Each design is handcrafted by a team of skilled master artisans from jaipur. Unique utilisation of various semi-precious stones and casting pieces add an interesting look to each piece.
